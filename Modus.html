            Modus Notes was a third-year design project where, as part of a team, I collaborated with Modus Coffee to craft a thoughtful design solution addressing a key problem identified through UX research. The project was meant to develop my skills as a UX researcher and involved conducting ethnographic research.

            <h2><span class="highlight">Project Overview</span></h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of a semester, our team partnered with Modus Coffee to address challenges in customer engagement through a UX-focused design process. We conducted extensive research to uncover key insights into the customer journey and identified a need for deeper interaction and connection with the brand.
            </p>
            <p>
                The result was Modus Notes, a solution designed to foster engagement by blending analog and digital touchpoints. Modus Notes were cards we designed which aimed to enhance user experience and encourage exploration of the Modus menu. This project combined research, participatory workshops, prototyping, and branding to deliver an innovative and customer-centric design solution.

            <h2>Who is Modus?</h2>
            <p>
                Modus Coffee is a specialty coffee brand based in Vancouver and was founded by the owner, Sharif, in 2015. What separates Modus from other coffee shops is their commitment to ethical sourcing, working only with local businesses to gather their ingredients. Additionally, they have a seasonal menu in which many items on the menu are rotated throughout the year. Together with Sharif, my team and I worked tirelessly to research the customer base for Modus and identify any problems and potential design solutions to help Sharif and his team grow their business.

                    To identify and address a user-centered problem, our team conducted comprehensive ethnographic research over the course of the semester. Using a range of research methods, we honed in on a specific challenge and crafted a solution tailored to the needs of the users. Along the way, we created posters to highlight key findings and proposed design solutions, iteratively refining our approach to arrive at a thoughtful and effective final outcome.

Featured here are examples such as our introduction of Modus, an ethnographic research poster, and a comprehensive user journey map, all designed to visually convey our process and findings.

            <h2>The One Trick Pony</h2>
            <p>Throughout the process, several personas were developed of Modus customers. The persona that had the strongest foundation and seemed to represent most coffee drinkers from the research was the one trick pony. The project was pushed forward with this persona in mind and design solutions were catered the one trick pony.</p> 

            <p>This customer orders the same drink every time no matter where they go. They don't feel comfortable branching out with new orders and prefer to stick with what they know. They find comfort in familiarity. Simplicity and convenience is the name of the game for the one trick pony. Below is a poster developed highlighting our persona's journey and potential design opportunities throughout.</p>

            <h2>Participatory Workshops</h2>
            <p>In the final phases of the research, to hammer down a refined user-centric solution, the team held participatory design workshops with users. The first was a sticky notes activity in which customers were asked a series of questions and had to write their answers down on sticky notes. The second was a moodboard activity where participants were given 3 prompts and were tasked with creating a moodboard for all 3 prompts. These workshops were held on Figma.</p>
            <p>The findings were insightful. Among some of the predictable results like users having a change of mood or associating coffee with relaxed/peaceful settings, we did find one key pattern across our users that drove us towards a final design solution. Customers enjoyed familiarity, comfort, and convenience. There was risk with trying new coffee and therefore many users chose to stick with the same order.</p>

                <p>After a thorough research process and numerous iterations on potential design solutions, our team developed Modus Notes: a creative and engaging approach to enhance the coffee experience. These playing card-style notes are designed to bridge the gap for non-specialty coffee drinkers by introducing a sense of playfulness and curiosity. Tailored specifically for the One Trick Pony persona, Modus Notes encourage exploration of the Modus menu, making it easier and less intimidating to step away from familiar choices while reducing the perceived risk of trying something new.</p>

            <p>
                Over the course of the semester, I learned invaluable skills in ethnographic research As part of the <span class="highlight">research and visual design team</span>, I was able to hone my skills as a designer. Learning how to empathize with my user group, our team was able to craft a user-centric solution that was ultimately approved by our client as well and is in the next stages of being implemented in the Modus cafe. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This project was the largest I’ve participated in regarding team size, involving a group of six individuals. While coordinating and maintaining effective communication was challenging at times, it was an invaluable learning experience. It enhanced my <span class="highlight">collaboration and soft skills, allowing me to effectively exchange ideas, appreciate diverse perspectives, and work cohesively toward a shared goal.</span>
