                This project was a part of a second year design course which challenged our ability to work through the design process. The goal was to develop a microsite to promote an upcoming event for our client, the NOF. The NOF are an opera house in switzerland who put on events every year, some original and some being new versions of old stories.

                Over the course of 5 weeks, our team was tasked with developing an art direction for our client (NOF), followed up with a microsite to promote their upcoming event, the klanggg festival. This project involved our team researching the work of a contemporary designer, designing posters to develop an art direction and finally iterating over and over until we landed on a final microsite.

        <h2>Researching Precedence</h2>
        <p>
            The first step was to research precedents and develop a series of design principles that would help carry our art direction. This involved researching a contemporary designer (Dan Friedman) and picking out design principles that he applied in his own work. The images below are examples of Friedman's posters that we studied as a team.

                With our principles defined and our precedence research completed, we moved on to defining an art direction for our microsite. To do this, the team was tasked with designing various posters of NOF shows. The posters were meant to visually attract audiences and promote the event while also define an art direction for the team to stick to as we move to the next phase of the project. Below are examples of our art exploration. The first poster is the art direction we ultimately decided to pursue.

            <p>The website’s goal was to target a pre-show experience. Where users can explore and learn about NOF’s opera’s stories, composers, and more behind the scenes. By emphasizing the pre-show experience, the hope was that customers would be more inclined to purchase tickets and attend events at the Klanggg Festival.</p>

            <p>The landing page loads in an interactive centerpiece meant to draw in the user and encourage interaction. Each of the four images represent an event during the festival and hovering over them will zoom in the page and provide more info on the event. Clicking on the image will lead to another animation which will take the user to the events pages,providing a full description of the event.</p>

            <p>The choice in animations and interactions were chosen to sell the expereince of the NOF and the Klanggg Festival as a whole. With the art direction meant to be fun and energizing, the team ensured that interactions remain the same.</p>

            <p> Our secondary pages are designed to highlight each event at the Klanggg Festival and promote it. In this content creation phase, the decision was made to focus these pages on background information of the events for the customer. Seeing as how opera audiences are generally a niche audience, there was an emphasis on providing detailed and engaging content that would resonate with their interests. This included offering insights into the stories, composers, historical context, and unique features of each opera. By catering to the niche audience's appreciation for depth and authenticity, the secondary pages aimed to enhance the pre-show experience and foster a stronger connection between the audience and the Klanggg Festival events. </p>

            <h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>
                Over the course of five weeks, our team faced significant stress to keep up with our classmates. Collaborating in a team of four taught me the value of clear role assignments. As the <span class="highlight">lead content designer and researcher and secondary visual designer</span>, I could focus on my tasks while trusting my teammates to deliver. I also learned how to use micro-interactions effectively to enhance a website’s experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project emphasized drawing inspiration from other designers and <span class="highlight">thinking laterally in the design process</span>. It taught me to let go of ideas that no longer fit and to balance multiple iterations—a challenging but rewarding experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were moments when our deliverables fell short and faced criticism, which was hard to hear. However, this taught me to <span class="highlight">trust our process and my teammates</span>, resulting in a polished final product that met expectations.
